# OpenAI_AHK_quick_chat

OpenAI_AHK_quick_chat is an AutoHotkey (AHK) script that integrates GPT-3 AI from OpenAI for any input field on your computer. It's a simple tool to send queries to the GPT-3 model and get responses in your clipboard.

## Installation

1. Install AutoHotkey from [here](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
2. Clone or download this repository and unzip the file.
3. Double-click the 'GPT3-AHK.ahk' file.
4. Generate an OpenAI API key following [this instruction](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key)
5. When prompted, input your OpenAI API key. The script will not function without an API key.

## Usage

1. The default shortcut to invoke the script is `Alt + Left Click`.
2. Once invoked, your clipboard contents will be filled into the text box.
3. Select an agent and write your message, then press `OK`. 
    - Choose `Try Again` to continue the conversation.
    - Select `Cancel` or `Continue` to close the dialogue window.
4. The response from GPT-3 will be copied to your clipboard.
   
To change your API key or modify the shortcut key, edit the 'settings.ini' file with a text editor.

To create or modify agents, edit the 'agents.ini' file. When adding a new agent:
- Assign a unique number to 'Name', 'SystemMsg', and 'Temperature' values.
- Update the 'ListLength' value.
  (this is a bit of a janky workaround, sorry)

To exit or reload the script after making changes, look for the robot icon in your system tray, usually located in the bottom right corner of your screen.

## File structure

The main script is `GPT3-AHK.ahk`. Here are the key parts of the script:

- `#SingleInstance`: This line ensures that only one instance of the script is running at a time.
- `MODEL_ID`, `MODEL_MAX_TOKENS`, `MODEL_TEMP`: These variables define the model to be used, the maximum tokens generated in the response, and the sampling temperature respectively.
- `MY_HOTKEY`: This variable sets the shortcut key for the script.
- `http := WinHttpRequest()`: This line initializes an HTTP request.
- `RunGPTAgent` and `AgainGPTAgent`: These are the main commands that handle the interaction with the GPT-3 model.
- `SetSystemCursor` and `RestoreCursors`: These functions manage the system cursor during the script's operation.

## Dependencies

The script uses the following dependencies:

- `WinHttpRequest`: An HTTP request module. Learn more [here](https://www.reddit.com/comments/mcjj4s/input).
- `cJson.ahk`: A JSON library for AutoHotkey. Access it [here](https://github.com/G33kDude/cJson.ahk).
